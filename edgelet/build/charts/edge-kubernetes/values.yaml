    # In order to benefit from HA, at a minimum the data location for iotedged
    # should be backed by a persistent volume. Please setup a persistent volume
    # and define a persistent volume claim and provide its reference below. If
    # this is not provided then the iotedged pod will default to using an
    # "emptyDir" volume which doesn't work for HA because its lifetime is linked
    # to the pod's lifetime.
